svm,"In machine learning, support vector machines are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis."
nnet,Neural Network (or Artificial Neural Network) has the ability to learn by examples. ANN is an information processing model inspired by the biological neuron system. It is composed of a large number of highly interconnected processing elements known as the neuron to solve problems. It follows the non-linear path and process information in parallel throughout the nodes. A neural network is a complex adaptive system. Adaptive means it has the ability to change its internal structure by adjusting weights of inputs.
rf,"Random Forest technique handles the overfitting problem you faced with decision trees. It grows multiple (very deep) classification trees using the training set. At the time of prediction, each tree is used to come up with a prediction and every outcome is counted as a vote. For example, if you have trained 3 trees with 2 saying a passenger in the test set will survive and 1 says he will not, the passenger will be classified as a survivor. This approach of overtraining trees, but having the majority's vote count as the actual classification decision, avoids overfitting."
